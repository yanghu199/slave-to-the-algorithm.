Week 4 

Research for pitch

After interpreted my rough idea about the narrative artist book with Karen, she was confused about the operation model of my system and the input, which reminded me that the book probably  is not appropriate for the definition of “generative design” because it is a finished outcome rather than a machine or system that can generate artifacts. Therefore I need to rethink about the whole system and I barely run out of my time!! 

For hunted and grabbed some inspirations about the theme for my system, I kept searching in Tate and MoMA’s website and an article suddenly engaged my attention, which critically discussed the relationship between human and physical substances. I always obsessed with curiosities and something weird, particularly focus on the personal stories or significance behind them. A number of artists already made lots of extraordinary artworks regarding this topic and some of them emphasis on how consumerism impact our personal belongings like Michael Landy, who famously destroyed everything he owned as a piece of performance art.

 “The insistent pressures on people to consume have become more and more present in our culture, and there is an increasing feeling of discomfort about how alienating these pressures can be. Michael, through Break Down, put his finger on a deeply troubling part of our contemporary condition.”

And also I found an artist who explore the conventions of archiving, exhibition making and museum display. Goshka Macuga’s sculptural environments often host unlikely displays of other artists’ work and disparate collections of objects – books, souvenirs, scraps, artfacts, and curios – with little regard for historical classification and hierarchies of value. Her selection of material is utterly subjective with everything considered equal. It follows a certain personal logic that is interested in the content, the form, and the meaning of an item, rather than its value. Macuga breathes life into her eccentric groupings of inanimate objects extending her curiosity beyond formal and material appreciation to an interest in human relationships. People are at the heart of Macuga’s practice.

I was interesting in how she recombined and displayed those objects and we had a common focus point ——  stories attached to individuals!  It inspired me that if I use a system instead of human logic to do the selection and combination of people’s items, what will happen? When goshka recombined those items, it presents a diversity meaning which different from the original one. And I start to wonder if the system become a decider, can it provide a new understanding in relationship between human and objects. 

Therefore an online personal meaningful / special / weird belongings library was my initial idea that participants can upload image/text/video/sound for their items and the system will establish a 3d model for them and everyone can see the stories behind these items. However, only one function was not enough if I want to explore the relationship deeply. Through continually researching, I found an artist who believed that physical reality can be replaced by digital reality.

“Gyonyoung Yoon’s project is about the change in perception that digital technology has brought to her life. When Yoon began living way from home, she faced a problem that she had never had before – to find a place where she belongs. Yoon struggled to make a home in physical reality for a long time, but she failed, so she came up with a solution of making a home in digital reality and it has been successful. Now, Yoon have her own sanctuary. She no longer feels detached. With this experience, she believes that physical reality can be replaced by digital reality. Yoon realised ‘home’ exists where her mind is, not where her body is.” 

I was inspired by the way that she combined the digital principles with her reality life and her emotion. She finds a real “home”in digital world and physicality does not affect the perception towards existence anymore. It gives me a new perspective of comprehending how digital world affect people’s physical life and emotion and I believe that will be a great starting point.

After email with Karen, she suggested me that this system could be an “emotion tracking and mapping machine”. Basically, users can upload their image/sound/video/text which they believe can present a kind of their emotion to this platform, those materials will be classified and recorded in the data library. And through the search bar, users can enter their affective needs And machine will respond it with resource in data library. The system may provide a search bar that participants can enter the keyword of their mental or physical needs . The system will match the input keywords with materials from data library. You can’t actually receive a specific answer but the responding  of system and those narratives and emotion behind the substances might inspired you.

With the Augmented Reality, users will have a virtual world that can reflect their spiritual needs. The system will scan the user’s environment or items in camera and analyses their personality and spiritual needs and provide a digital world which constituted by materials from data library and the system will connect them with user’s physical environment/object on screen. It provides a chance that users can experience a diversity version of the emotion mapped by their belongings. It seems like we have conversation with the system but actually we are talking to some physical substances that upload by other users. The machine provides a new understanding of how physical substances affect our emotion and reserve story. Also it use an objective intellection to build connection between each users with emotion visualization.
