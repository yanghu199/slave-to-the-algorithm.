'1194D is originally a tweak of 115C8 (vimeo.com/45569702), one of my "Algorithmic Creature" series based on recursive triangle subdivision. The idea and complexity of the work started to go beyond the initial expectation after I decided to experiment with multiple "creatures" co-existing within the environment. So I created this grid with regular tetrahedron as its unit cell, put these triangle-based "creatures" into this environment and tested their mutation and combination in various ways.The entire work is programmed and generated in Processing, with a few scenes using some blur and blend modes in Premiere during composition stage.'

Those triangles subdivision created some extraordinary scenes that exceeded my imagination of what processing can do.

‘This is a Magazine presents a new publishing experiment in robo-typography and machinic-drawing called Livedraw. Livedraw is a networked, artist-machine collaborative publishing project, consisting of a custom-made drawing-robot capable of producing "live-drawn" works in natural-media on paper. Artists, designers and writers from the This is a magazine (about nothing) project are invited to contribute works to the project via a custom-coded application that captures their drawing-movements and automatically combines and transmits them to the drawing-robot which draws unique editions.’

Karen and Andy showed us their project about livedraw, which is a really cool and futuristic auto-machine and this experiment can represent a kind of development tendency of drawing ---- collaborated with machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. If this machine can capture the movement in the video,  what will the machine draw when it watch the video from Picasso?


Then we started to concreate on fixing bug. I was still stuck in the code development of collage machine. I tried to search the other method of matching multipul keywords in github, and I found some : https://github.com/oskmkr/nodejs-module/blob/2345c7236d596476a7bea0b9fc6505dda3d65842/express-mvc/controllers/keywords.js
https://github.com/matan3sh/meme-generator/blob/6a710e8f5a5874acf661bb557a735417e1dcf052/js/images-service.js
https://github.com/giladberg/meme-generator/blob/021077bc654e6177bd67abd4bcfa134ce241f2c1/js/memeService.js

I also came to ask my friend who learned coding before for help and she suggested that I can use the json format to connect my image with multipul keywords liked that:

so image1,2,3,4... can be represented as 'idx'.
