week1

This was my first time coming into contact with generative design and programming and Karen showed us some extraordinary interaction examples that all combined coding and visual art perfectly. One of my favorite projects is “I Said If”by Lia, the device she displays on the website which reminds me of the working theory of refractor.

“Lia’s art is communication – a game with the principle of the “user”. Her working material is code, digital poetry, which no longer has anything in common with the traditional use. With numerous experiments and consciously evoked irregularities, she creates programs in an unmistakable style that trigger formal and acoustic events. On the basis of the beginning settings she provides and the possibilites thereby permitted, players can steer the course of the application themselves. Her art consequently corresponds to the idea of “creation”, the invention of a self-controlling system that evolves from an original configuration.”

“Workout computer”is a project that literally can turn your office work into an intense exercise, not in the gym but can be in your studio or house. The combination of a series of punching bags and computers really inspired me that maybe I can bring together the algorithm and the mixed media in my final project.
“The project is tied to the Istanbul Biennial's general theme of The Future Is Not What It Used To Be. Bless's computer examines the progression of digital technologies, suggesting that in creating devices that continually make life easier and more sedentary, developers and their work run contrary to other aspects of human existence. "It totally blanks out the physical needs we have," says Heiss. "What we exhibited in Istanbul is what we consider a good prototype for another idea of work."

I start to wonder how numbers and letters transfer into picture and animation, what software will artist use and how they do well with the combination of their ideas and programming. Karen used a simple group game to interpret how generative design works. We determined our parameters which included the shape and used what kind of gestures to draw and then used dice to decide the order.

The outcome didn’t look good and more like a scrawl but the process can explain how programming work.

Then we were asked to download processing to prepare for next week. I attempted to follow the tutorial which basically taught you how to make different kinds of curves with foundation parameters. Bezier function has 8 parameters:
bezier(x1, y1, cpx1, cpy1, cpx2, cpy2, x2, y2)
But I still don’t understand these numbers of coordinates that they are specific or following some rules which are unknown for me now. for all these questions wish I will get responses next week.


week2

Research before start to learn processing

![cindermedusae_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68723373/96445951-4c786700-1243-11eb-90c1-371dd8f16634.jpg)

I found a really impressive generative book which designed and generated by Marcin Ignac, who is the originator of Variable as well. Every creature that printed in this generative book were unique and comprised of procedural geometry.(yes they don’t exist in the real world). And he even set a website that allows participants to create their own underwater creatures and control their behaviors! In this interactive installation system, he used parameters of giant jellyfish for the input，output images at hi-res print quality he decided to use OpenGL and new library called Cinder. This allowed to achieve near realtime performance (4000 x 3000 px animated pictures) and prototype very fast. 

Here is the link:http://marcinignac.com/projects/cindermedusae/

This project really inspired me and it gave me comprehensive sight and understanding of generative design. Maybe I can create a storytelling digital artist book with animation in a website for the final project? I believe that at this stage all we learned was the process and basic tool for building the algorithm system. But  what kind of contents and significants that the system provides for the participant are the most valuable elements. Therefore I would probably select outcomes that can convey a series of contents rather than a purely visual effect.

Then we started to learn an essential tool for generative design. Basically I knew nothing about processing before, luckily Karen started the tutorial with some fundamental geometric shapes and simple interactive parameters like rotation and mouse/keypress. After that we were asked to create our selfies with these basic parameters. (And I was surprised by everyone’s works, which looked super amazing and cute! Really enjoyed this process) 

<img width="748" alt="upload images in processing" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68723373/96445580-b3495080-1242-11eb-86bb-8d2ccaae1937.png">

now I’m attempting to follow some tutorials for beginners in processing’s website regarding how to upload images instead of geometry patterns. however, when I try to combine them with mouse pressed, images just disappear after the click.(help!!) 

Although I keep searching and googling diverse outcomes of generative design, it still can’t provide any ideas for my algorithm in pitch and that’s worried me. Hopefully I can have some inspirations  before the class next week.


week3

12 hours challenge

Make up this activity for week2! I was inspired by my painting elective and wondered what about established an abstract painting system? As we needed to set up in processing before the main orders, I created a color pick-up system and divided the canvas into 6 pieces in order to build the coordinate. Moreover, a material pick-up system was also essential. After finished all basic settings, I started to classify contents by human or non-human objects. In human category I selected gender/ages/movement/clothes and for non-human I got 5 sorts of stuffs : botany/building/artifact/animal/fruit.

Class activity

“Margie Livingston asking the earth to make its mark on her — by way of her artwork. For her recent series, she straps on a harness with a canvas attached and drags it facedown behind her as she traverses various environments, letting the dirt, gravel and bumps determine the image. There is something penitent about this process. The wearing of the harness recalls a hairshirt, a sense of shame and apology.For her new show, Extreme Landscape Painting, at Greg Kucera Gallery, Livingston added layers of gouache and acrylic to the panels before taking them for long walks outdoors, sometimes on days-long camping trips. As a result of the journey (and the dirt picked up along the way), the paintings have a scratchy visual quality. Peering into them is like trying to make out a voice coming through a bad connection. What is the earth trying to tell us?”

https://crosscut.com/2018/11/seattle-galleries-art-meets-climate-change

I was impressed by Margie’s unique drawing method, which was presented her communication with earth intensely.  Rather than express what she feels and thoughts, Margie chooses to receive the emotion from nature. A number of parodic elements are going on here: the regional obsession with nature in the wild; a religious devotion to painting, as if the artist were undergoing penitence on the trail; and the somber tradition of minimalism. 

After Karen introduced some automatically painting installations, we started to create our own machine. I wondered that what stuffs in my apartment could provide the motive power.  Obviously, my naughty little kitty could fit that character perfectly. Initially, I decided to use pigments to present her footprints. Meanwhile, I noticed that she was kept licking her arms and legs; therefore it was not appropriate. Then I used double side type to stick a charcoal on her leg and put her into a box that had no covering. She wasn’t cooperative at all and struggled with that charcoal and attempted to get rid of it in the whole process.(much harder than I imagined) The outcome was quite random and more like a sketch from a psychopath. Anyway I appreciated your help eggy:)


About pitch

Relevant research

“The Future Lab Program™ T is an interactive tabletop projector that uses touch to control images projected onto a tabletop or object. Sony’s unique sensing technologies help it detect movement, height and angle of the fingers of multiple users, allowing it to discern gestures and project them as images for a newly intuitive interaction. We announced the concept prototype and loaned it out to developers in 2016 for co-creation, pursuing a minimalist structure like a lab tool, with ideal shape for heat release. Other features include a height-adjusting lock mechanism and a stand built to help manage cords.”

https://ifworlddesignguide.com/entry/208077-future-lab-program-t

This “T” program in Sony future lab supports a multiple experiences with physical storybooks, which invites participants to interact with those animations that the projector   provides. The form of future digital artist books might look similar with the “T” project and I believe it still has infinite possibilities to explore.



week4

Research for pitch

After interpreted my rough idea about the narrative artist book with Karen, she was confused about the operation model of my system and the input, which reminded me that the book probably  is not appropriate for the definition of “generative design” because it is a finished outcome rather than a machine or system that can generate artifacts. Therefore I need to rethink about the whole system and I barely run out of my time!! 

For hunted and grabbed some inspirations about the theme for my system, I kept searching in Tate and MoMA’s website and an article suddenly engaged my attention, which critically discussed the relationship between human and physical substances. I always obsessed with curiosities and something weird, particularly focus on the personal stories or significance behind them. A number of artists already made lots of extraordinary artworks regarding this topic and some of them emphasis on how consumerism impact our personal belongings like Michael Landy, who famously destroyed everything he owned as a piece of performance art.

 “The insistent pressures on people to consume have become more and more present in our culture, and there is an increasing feeling of discomfort about how alienating these pressures can be. Michael, through Break Down, put his finger on a deeply troubling part of our contemporary condition.” 

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160713-michael-landy-the-man-who-destroyed-all-his-belongings

And also I found an artist who explore the conventions of archiving, exhibition making and museum display. Goshka Macuga’s sculptural environments often host unlikely displays of other artists’ work and disparate collections of objects – books, souvenirs, scraps, artfacts, and curios – with little regard for historical classification and hierarchies of value. Her selection of material is utterly subjective with everything considered equal. It follows a certain personal logic that is interested in the content, the form, and the meaning of an item, rather than its value. Macuga breathes life into her eccentric groupings of inanimate objects extending her curiosity beyond formal and material appreciation to an interest in human relationships. People are at the heart of Macuga’s practice. 

https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-now-goshka-macuga/objects-relation-essay

I was interesting in how she recombined and displayed those objects and we had a common focus point ——  stories attached to individuals!  It inspired me that if I use a system instead of human logic to do the selection and combination of people’s items, what will happen? When goshka recombined those items, it presents a diversity meaning which different from the original one. And I start to wonder if the system become a decider, can it provide a new understanding in relationship between human and objects. 

Therefore an online personal meaningful / special / weird belongings library was my initial idea that participants can upload image/text/video/sound for their items and the system will establish a 3d model for them and everyone can see the stories behind these items. However, only one function was not enough if I want to explore the relationship deeply. Through continually researching, I found an artist who believed that physical reality can be replaced by digital reality. 

“Gyonyoung Yoon’s project is about the change in perception that digital technology has brought to her life. When Yoon began living way from home, she faced a problem that she had never had before – to find a place where she belongs. Yoon struggled to make a home in physical reality for a long time, but she failed, so she came up with a solution of making a home in digital reality and it has been successful. Now, Yoon have her own sanctuary. She no longer feels detached. With this experience, she believes that physical reality can be replaced by digital reality. Yoon realised ‘home’ exists where her mind is, not where her body is.” 

I was inspired by the way that she combined the digital principles with her reality life and her emotion. She finds a real “home”in digital world and physicality does not affect the perception towards existence anymore. It gives me a new perspective of comprehending how digital world affect people’s physical life and emotion and I believe that will be a great starting point.

After email with Karen, she suggested me that this system could be an “emotion tracking and mapping machine”. Basically, users can upload their image/sound/video/text which they believe can present a kind of their emotion to this platform, those materials will be classified and recorded in the data library. and through the search bar, users can enter their affective needs And machine will respond it with resource in data library. With the Augmented Reality, users will have a virtual world that can reflect their spiritual needs. It seems like we have conversation with the system but actually we are talking to some physical substances that upload by other users. The machine provides a new understanding of how physical substances affect our emotion and reserve story. Also it use an objective intellection to build connection between each users with emotion visualization.
