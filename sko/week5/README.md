Emotion mapping machine

I was surrounded by these substantial wonderful ideas on the presentation day. Everyone did lots of relative research and interpreted their system clearly. It was so interesting to see many of us decided to focus on the emotion mapping machine yet the specific functions and working theory of the system were totally different. The significance and idea of Hun’s machine and JinNi’s process and outcomes might have similarities with mine. me and hun both concentrated on emotion visualization, however, the input of his machine is brainwave data which sounds more scientifically. My machine will more follow with interest in the narrative function of the user’s personal belongings.

wunderkammer

In Karen’s feedback, she mentioned the “wunderkammer”,  or cabinets of curiosities, arose in mid-sixteenth-century Europe as repositories for all manner of wondrous and exotic objects.

“In essence these collections—combining specimens, diagrams, and illustrations from many disciplines; marking the intersection of science and superstition; and drawing on natural, manmade, and artificial worlds—can be seen as the precursors to museums. This exhibition presents a contemporary interpretation of the traditional cabinet of curiosities, bringing together a diverse selection of works by twentieth- and twenty-first-century artists who have likewise felt the pull of unusual and extraordinary objects and phenomena. The works on display include prints, books, multiples, drawings, and photographs, with subjects ranging from architectural marvels and blueprints for impossible machines to oddities from the animal, vegetable, and mineral worlds. Featured artists include Hans Bellmer, Peter Blake, Louise Bourgeois, Max Ernst, and Damien Hirst, among others.”

wunderkammer and my system both presents objects, yet mine is more focus on significance and emotion rather than curiosities and unusual items. 


practicable plan

The initial function of this machine involved online substances library, search bar and AR. To translate the 2d photo into 3d modeling, the critical component of this process is combined the system with 3d photoscan or Autodesk 123D Catch. And I also find that there are a couple of applications in App Store which support scanning objects and generate 3d modeling automatically. (Qlone) the problem is how to connect these scanning applications with my website and data library.


New idea

Instead of the search function, it seems like a virtual mirror which can project participant’s inner desire onto a mixture items that generated by the system sounds more interesting. basically the mirror support voice input so users can just need to talk with it and the system will match the keyword with the items from the data library and select some of their pieces to recombine them randomly. Users will receive a mixture item(maybe looks abstract and undistinguished) which visualize their inner desire.
