Week 12

Pop up exhibition

I felt so lucky to select this studio and study with these genius people !! In this pop up exhibition, I was surrounded by these extraordinary and diverse projects that presented every single’s  personality and interesting thoughts.

KaiQi’s project reflected a care and social concern regarding the quarantine time and aimed to remissive the pressure and panic for public.  Her beautiful installation really gave people energy of inner healing. Hun’s idea of present the beauty of nature also really impressive, he combined the motion capture sensor and visualized the track of birds.

Additionally, Jinni, Louis, sylvain… they all had a well considered UI design of their website and fluent users experience, which was the part that I needed to improvement for my further development. ( continuously reduced the size of the images and model file, added the button that can come back to the homepage…) This pop up exhibition was a huge step that can prove our effort in learning coding from 0 to a new beginner. 


Reflection 

I even didn’t know that the website actually was a file and constituted by coding at the beginning of this semester. Generative design? Never heard this concept before.  I couldn’t imagine that in one day I can understand and even write code by myself and it could work!  Looked back to the whole journey that we experienced, we spent five weeks to learn the basic code of how to create ellipse, geometric shape, simple mouse interaction in processing and started to build the concept, structure of our personal system. Seven weeks to learn some more complex coding and plugins (sound.js, speech.js…) and keep debugging with patience. More importantly, difficulties pushed me to self-learning and searched, asked every platform that have methods or knowledges about the information I needed. I realized that if I didn't truly understand each function's usages, then I couldn't write codes that can work.

This studio definitely was the best one since I learnt in RMIT, it not only contained the basis knowledge of coding, but also the process of developing the initial concept to an outstanding completed projects with deeper comprehensive of human-machine cooperation and interaction.  This studio provided a powerful tools and a starting points for us, as communication designers, we are facing the adjustment and challenge from the collaboration of artificial intelligence and design industry. We are not satisfied the traditional limitation that just used PS,AI,ID… to make a poster or logo or business card, we need innovation. Generative design bridges the gap between science and the humanities, and an increasing number of creative agencies and studios are arming themselves with these promising emerging technologies to make them more attractive to the market. On the other hand, we create engaging design with algorithms, but we are not the actual ‘slave’ to them.  Designers can't expect to be the best at the technical level, and design ends up being a matter of ideas and concepts. At the technical level, there are people who can do everything better, but it takes time to get the right information, concepts, and visual representations, and put them all together with an appropriate way.  Generative design is more than just pressing a button and selecting generate. Designers still need to consider many aspects such as the structure, process, behavior of system, what’s the input and output, debugging the every single accident in coding… and I’m obsessive with the uncertainty and accidental elements that enrich the process of design and create a scene that is difficult for designers to predict in the early stage of design.
