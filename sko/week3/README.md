the outcome from the drawing machin


Make up this activity for week2! I was inspired by my painting elective and wondered what about established an abstract painting system? As we needed to set up in processing before the main orders, I created a color pick-up system and divided the canvas into 6 pieces in order to build the coordinate. Moreover, a material pick-up system was also essential. After finished all basic settings, I started to classify contents by human or non-human objects. In human category I selected gender/ages/movement/clothes and for non-human I got 5 sorts of stuffs : botany/building/artifact/animal/fruit.


Class activity

“Margie Livingston asking the earth to make its mark on her — by way of her artwork. For her recent series, she straps on a harness with a canvas attached and drags it facedown behind her as she traverses various environments, letting the dirt, gravel and bumps determine the image. There is something penitent about this process. The wearing of the harness recalls a hairshirt, a sense of shame and apology.For her new show, Extreme Landscape Painting, at Greg Kucera Gallery, Livingston added layers of gouache and acrylic to the panels before taking them for long walks outdoors, sometimes on days-long camping trips. As a result of the journey (and the dirt picked up along the way), the paintings have a scratchy visual quality. Peering into them is like trying to make out a voice coming through a bad connection. What is the earth trying to tell us?”

I was impressed by Margie’s unique drawing method, which was presented her communication with earth intensely.  Rather than express what she feels and thoughts, Margie chooses to receive the emotion from nature. A number of parodic elements are going on here: the regional obsession with nature in the wild; a religious devotion to painting, as if the artist were undergoing penitence on the trail; and the somber tradition of minimalism.

After Karen introduced some automatically painting installations, we started to create our own machine. I wondered that what stuffs in my apartment could provide the motive power.  Obviously, my naughty little kitty could fit that character perfectly. Initially, I decided to use pigments to present her footprints. Meanwhile, I noticed that she was kept licking her arms and legs; therefore it was not appropriate. Then I used double side type to stick a charcoal on her leg and put her into a box that had no covering. She wasn’t cooperative at all and struggled with that charcoal and attempted to get rid of it in the whole process.(much harder than I imagined) The outcome was quite random and more like a sketch from a psychopath. Anyway I appreciated your help eggy:)


About pitch

Relevant research

“The Future Lab Program™ T is an interactive tabletop projector that uses touch to control images projected onto a tabletop or object. Sony’s unique sensing technologies help it detect movement, height and angle of the fingers of multiple users, allowing it to discern gestures and project them as images for a newly intuitive interaction. We announced the concept prototype and loaned it out to developers in 2016 for co-creation, pursuing a minimalist structure like a lab tool, with ideal shape for heat release. Other features include a height-adjusting lock mechanism and a stand built to help manage cords.”

This “T” program in Sony future lab supports a multiple experiences with physical storybooks, which invites participants to interact with those animations that the projector   provides. The form of future digital artist books might look similar with the “T” project and I believe it still has infinite possibilities to explore.
