Research before start to learn processing

I found a really impressive generative book which designed and generated by Marcin Ignac, who is the originator of Variable as well. Every creature that printed in this generative book were unique and comprised of procedural geometry.(yes they don’t exist in the real world). And he even set a website that allows participants to create their own underwater creatures and control their behaviors! In this interactive installation system, he used parameters of giant jellyfish for the input，output images at hi-res print quality he decided to use OpenGL and new library called Cinder. This allowed to achieve near realtime performance (4000 x 3000 px animated pictures) and prototype very fast.

This project really inspired me and it gave me comprehensive sight and understanding of generative design. Maybe I can create a storytelling digital artist book with animation in a website for the final project? I believe that at this stage all we learned was the process and basic tool for building the algorithm system. But  what kind of contents and significants that the system provides for the participant are the most valuable elements. Therefore I would probably select outcomes that can convey a series of contents rather than a purely visual effect.

Then we started to learn an essential tool for generative design. Basically I knew nothing about processing before, luckily Karen started the tutorial with some fundamental geometric shapes and simple interactive parameters like rotation and mouse/keypress. After that we were asked to create our selfies with these basic parameters. (And I was surprised by everyone’s works, which looked super amazing and cute! Really enjoyed this process)

now I’m attempting to follow some tutorials for beginners in processing’s website regarding how to upload images instead of geometry patterns. however, when I try to combine them with mouse pressed, images just disappear after the click.(help!!) 

Although I keep searching and googling diverse outcomes of generative design, it still can’t provide any ideas for my algorithm in pitch and that’s worried me. Hopefully I can have some inspirations before the class next week.
