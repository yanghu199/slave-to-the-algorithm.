week1

This was my first time coming into contact with generative design and programming and Karen showed us some extraordinary interaction examples that all combined coding and visual art perfectly. One of my favorite projects is “I Said If”by Lia, the device she displays on the website which reminds me of the working theory of refractor.

“Lia’s art is communication – a game with the principle of the “user”. Her working material is code, digital poetry, which no longer has anything in common with the traditional use. With numerous experiments and consciously evoked irregularities, she creates programs in an unmistakable style that trigger formal and acoustic events. On the basis of the beginning settings she provides and the possibilites thereby permitted, players can steer the course of the application themselves. Her art consequently corresponds to the idea of “creation”, the invention of a self-controlling system that evolves from an original configuration.”

“Workout computer”is a project that literally can turn your office work into an intense exercise, not in the gym but can be in your studio or house. The combination of a series of punching bags and computers really inspired me that maybe I can bring together the algorithm and the mixed media in my final project.
“The project is tied to the Istanbul Biennial's general theme of The Future Is Not What It Used To Be. Bless's computer examines the progression of digital technologies, suggesting that in creating devices that continually make life easier and more sedentary, developers and their work run contrary to other aspects of human existence. "It totally blanks out the physical needs we have," says Heiss. "What we exhibited in Istanbul is what we consider a good prototype for another idea of work."

I start to wonder how numbers and letters transfer into picture and animation, what software will artist use and how they do well with the combination of their ideas and programming. Karen used a simple group game to interpret how generative design works. We determined our parameters which included the shape and used what kind of gestures to draw and then used dice to decide the order.

The outcome didn’t look good and more like a scrawl but the process can explain how programming work.

Then we were asked to download processing to prepare for next week. I attempted to follow the tutorial which basically taught you how to make different kinds of curves with foundation parameters. Bezier function has 8 parameters:
bezier(x1, y1, cpx1, cpy1, cpx2, cpy2, x2, y2)
But I still don’t understand these numbers of coordinates that they are specific or following some rules which are unknown for me now. for all these questions wish I will get responses next week.
